# Asteroids_World
A game loosely-based on asteroids but with many more features and more dynamic gameplay.


Written in Java using LibGDX for rendering, Box2d for physics, and the Ashley entity-component system. 


Upgrade your ship, complete missions, fight smart AI-controlled enemies. A modernized version of asteroids that focuses on skill-based gameplay where every second and every keystroke counts.

This game will be released for free and if it gets noticed even a little bit, It will be used as a demonstration and promotion piece on kickstarter to help fund a sequal: Asteroids World Online!
